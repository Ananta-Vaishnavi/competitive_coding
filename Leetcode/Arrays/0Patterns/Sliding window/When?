A question that uses a list or data type that must be iterated over in sequence is a great candidate for a sliding window.
Lastly, one of the biggest clues that one can use a sliding window is the word contiguous. Remember: in the context of programming, contiguous means that the elements are sequentially placed next to each other.
Some common data structures one will be using a sliding window on are strings, arrays, and even linked lists.

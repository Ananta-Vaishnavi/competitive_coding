A question that uses a list or data type that must be iterated over in sequence is a great candidate for a sliding window.
Lastly, one of the biggest clues that one can use a sliding window is the word contiguous. Remember: in the context of programming, contiguous means that the elements are sequentially placed next to each other.
Some common data structures one will be using a sliding window on are strings, arrays, and even linked lists.
This questions checks off nearly all of the criteria mentioned above for using a sliding window. It has:

1] String as input.
2] Contiguous elements requirement.
3] The entire string must be iterated over.
4] The longest substring must be found.


sliding window
array sum
sub-array/sub-string
largest/smallest/maximum/minimum
k
———————————————————————
two types of sliding window
1}  fixed size
      it is given in the question
2}  variable size slide window
      it is not given in the question instead it is asked to find the maximum or minimum size sliding window

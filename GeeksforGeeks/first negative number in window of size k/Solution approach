-----------------------Sliding window--------------------------------
Here instead of using two conditions i took two loops.
I did this to store the first basic result of the sliding window which can be updated later. Here I used a list.
Next, I have used a while loop to transverse through the array and I increment the two pointers start and the end.
Later I updated the list accordingly by popping when the start-1 element equals the first element in the list.
I have appended zero whenever there was nothing in list.
